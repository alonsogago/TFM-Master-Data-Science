# Welcome to my Masters' Thesis repository
Here you'll find the code and result files of my work.

If you want to execute the code to test if it works you'll need an Amazon Bedrock account configured and a Qdrant server running.

[app.ipynb](https://github.com/alonsogago/TFM-Master-Data-Science/blob/main/app.ipynb) creates and performs the necesary operations for the Basic and Advanced RAG structures, while [multiagent.ipynb](https://github.com/alonsogago/TFM-Master-Data-Science/blob/main/multiagent.ipynb) creates the MultiAgent System.
[metrics.ipynb](https://github.com/alonsogago/TFM-Master-Data-Science/blob/main/metrics.ipynb) is used to obtain the results.

Enjoy!
